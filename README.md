The **Lyra_MSS_AMT** project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to music source separation (MSS) and automatic music transcription (AMT) of traditional Cretan lyra dance tunes. 
The MSS system was trained using the **Crete2019 dataset**, which provided a robust foundation for separating the various musical sources. 
This system was then used to isolate lyra stems from the **SOUSTA Corpus** dataset, which became the dataset of choice for training and evaluating the AMT system. 
By applying the monophonic AMT models, this research aims to accurately transcribe the complex, non-Western musical characteristics of the Cretan lyra. 
The project presents a novel approach to handling traditional music genres through a combination of MSS and AMT, contributing to the preservation of Cretan musical heritage while pushing the boundaries of AMT technology.

A live demo of both systems can be accessed through the [Lyra_MSS_AMT - Demo](https://sifmanos.github.io/Lyra_MSS_AMT/), where users can explore their performance.
