The **Lyra-MSS-AMT** project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to music source separation (MSS) and automatic music transcription (AMT) of traditional Cretan lyra dance tunes. The MSS system was trained using the **Crete2019 dataset**, which provided a robust foundation for separating the various musical sources. This system was then used to isolate lyra stems from the **SOUSTA Corpus** dataset, which became the dataset of choice for training and evaluating the AMT system. By applying the monophonic AMT models, this research aims to accurately transcribe the complex, non-Western musical characteristics of the Cretan lyra. The project presents a novel approach to handling traditional music genres through a combination of MSS and AMT, contributing to the preservation of Cretan musical heritage while pushing the boundaries of AMT technology.

A live demo of both systems can be accessed through the [Lyra-MSS-AMT - Demo](https://sifmanos.github.io/Lyra-MSS-AMT/), where users can explore their performance.

A notable achievement is the presentation of a peer-reviewed [abstract](https://github.com/sifmanos/Lyra-MSS-AMT/blob/main/docs/Holzapfel-Sifakis_AAWM24.pdf) and demos for the MSS and AMT systems at the [AAWM 2024 Conference](https://iftawm.org/conferences/), held on June 10â€“14, 2024, at the University of Bologna. This event showcased the integration of traditional music with technological advancements and facilitated engagement with experts in MIR and ethnomusicology.
